        <h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-neutral-200">Short Bio</h2>
        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg">My core expertise lies in PHP (especially Drupal and Laravel), and I'm equally enthusiastic about Linux, Docker, and emerging tech like LLMs. To be honest I have a passion for all things tech. Outside the coding realm, you will often find me exploring the world of photography or simply enjoying time with my girlfriend (she's amazing and helps me with design and life in general).</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold lg:mt-10 sm:mt-6 dark:text-neutral-200">Career</h2>
        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg">I started my journey in web development at 17 during an internship through my professional high school, just as Drupal 7 was being released. That experience sparked my passion for building the web, and I’ve been honing my skills ever since. For the past five years, I’ve been working as a contractor at the European Commission, delivering scalable web solutions and continuously growing as a developer.</p>
