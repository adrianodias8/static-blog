Install Static CLI: First, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, open your terminal and run:

`npm install -g @devdojo/static`

This command installs the Static CLI globally, allowing you to create and manage your static sites with ease.

Create a New Project: Navigate to the directory where you want your project to reside and run:

`static new my-static-site`

Replace my-static-site with your desired project name. This command creates a new folder with all the necessary files for your static site.

Navigate to Your Project Folder:

`cd my-static-site`

Move into your project's directory to start working on it.

Start the Development Server: Launch the local development server with:

`static dev`

Your site is now running locally at http://localhost:3000/. Open this URL in your browser to view your site.
